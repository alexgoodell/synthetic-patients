Clinician: Good morning, Mr. Green. I'm Alexis Wang, your surgeon. How are you feeling today?

Patient: Ah, hello Dr. Wang. Um, I'm doing okay, considering. Just a bit anxious about the whole situation and what comes next.

Clinician: Ah, it's completely understandable to feel anxious. Um, before we talk about next steps, could you tell me what you understand about your diagnosis so far?

Patient: Well, I know that I have a glioblastoma, which is a type of brain tumor. My oncologist said it's serious and that surgery, followed by radiation and chemotherapy, are the recommended treatments. Um, I've also tried to read up on it a bit... concerned about how it all affects my brain functions, you know?

Clinician: Yes, your concerns are valid. Glioblastoma is indeed a serious condition, and it's good that you're seeking to understand more about it. Surgery aims to remove as much of the tumor as possible, while minimizing impact on brain function. Um, any specific concerns about the effects on your brain functions we can address right now?

Patient: Ah, yes, um, I'm really worried about how the treatment, especially the surgery, might affect my cognition. I, uh, work as a software engineer, and being able to think clearly is... it's critical for me. And, um, I've got two daughters to look after by myself. Just trying to understand, you know, what kind of impact I might be looking at here.

Clinician: I completely understand your concerns, Mr. Green. It's important to maintain as much of your cognitive function as possible, especially given your profession and your role as a father. The effects can vary, but we'll tailor the surgery and follow-up treatments to try to preserve your cognitive abilities as best as we can. We can also explore supportive therapies and rehabilitation to support your recovery. How does that sound?

Patient: Ah, that sounds, um, reassuring. Are there, um, specific types of supportive therapies and rehabilitation that people in my situation typically go through? Just trying to get a sense of, you know, what the recovery might look like.

Clinician: Yes, there are several types of supportive therapies and rehabilitation that can be beneficial. These can include physical therapy to help with coordination and strength, occupational therapy to assist with daily activities, and cognitive rehabilitation to aid memory and thinking skills. We'll work closely with the rehabilitation team to customize a plan that meets your specific needs. How does meeting with a rehabilitation specialist to discuss further sound?

Patient: Ah, meeting with a rehabilitation specialist sounds helpful, Dr. Wang. Um, getting a clearer picture of what to expect and how to best prepare for recovery will really ease some of my worries. Thank you for suggesting it.

Clinician: You're welcome, Mr. Green. Ensuring you're as comfortable and informed as possible is very important to us. We'll arrange for that meeting with the rehabilitation specialist soon. Is there anything else you're wondering about or that I can help with today?

Patient: Um, yeah, actually. I've, uh, been concerned about the time I'll need off from work. Since I'm the only one taking care of my daughters, it's crucial I plan this out. How long do people in my situation usually take to recover enough to return to work?

Clinician: Ah, recovery time can vary quite a bit depending on several factors, including the specifics of the surgery and your individual response to the rehabilitation. Typically, patients may start to return to work on a part-time basis within 6 to 8 weeks after surgery, but it could be longer. We'll closely monitor your recovery and adjust based on how you're doing. It's crucial to balance your health with your responsibilities, and we'll support you through this process.

Patient: Ah, that gives me a better idea of the timeline, Dr. Wang. Thank you for clarifying. It sounds like a careful adjustment period, but knowing I might be able to start getting back to work within a few months is helpful. I'll make sure to discuss this with my employer and plan accordingly.

Clinician: Absolutely, Mr. Green. Keeping the lines of communication open with your employer is a good approach. We'll provide you with all the necessary documentation and support to facilitate those discussions. If there's anything else you need or have questions about, please don't hesitate to ask.
